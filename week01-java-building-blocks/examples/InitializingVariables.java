/*
 * Notes
 * 
 	On the exam, be wary of any local variable that is declared but not initialized
	in a single line. This is a common place on the exam that could result
	in a “Does not compile” answer. As you saw in the previous examples, you
	are not required to initialize the variable on the same line it is defined, but
	be sure to check to make sure it’s initialized before it’s used on the exam.

		//A local variable is a variable defined within a constructor, method, or initializer block
		
		/*Passing Constructor and Method Parameters
		Variables passed to a constructor or method are called constructor parameters or method
		parameters , respectively*/
		
		/*Defining Instance and Class Variables
		 
		 An instance variable, often called a field, is a value defined within a specific
		instance of an object. Let’s say we have a Person class with an instance variable name of
		type String. Each instance of the class would have its own value for name, such as Elysia
		or Sarah.

		On the other hand, a class variable is one that is defined on the class level and shared
		among all instances of the class. 
		A variable is a class variable if it has the "static" keyword
		in its declaration!!!
		
		Instance and class variables do not require you to initialize them.
