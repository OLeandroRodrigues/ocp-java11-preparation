# Week 02 â€“ Operators

## ðŸ“š Weekly Summary

This week's focus is on mastering Java's operators and understanding how they influence expressions and program flow. We'll cover:

- Arithmetic Operators
- Relational Operators
- Logical Operators
- Assignment Operators
- Unary Operators
- Increment and Decrement
- Operator Precedence and Associativity
- The `instanceof` Operator
- Ternary Conditional Operator

## ðŸŽ¯ Weekly Objective

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

- Use arithmetic operators to perform mathematical calculations
- Compare values using relational operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`)
- Combine conditions with logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`)
- Apply assignment operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`) efficiently
- Utilize unary operators, including increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`)
- Correctly interpret operator precedence and associativity to avoid logical errors
- Use the `instanceof` operator to check object type at runtime
- Implement concise conditional logic with the ternary (`?:`) operator
