/*Notes
 Equality Operators
 	Determining equality in Java can be a nontrivial endeavor as there’s a semantic difference
	between “two objects are the same” and “two objects are equivalent.” It is further complicated
	by the fact that for numeric and boolean primitives, there is no such distinction.
	
	Table 3.6 Equality operators
	Operator 				Apply to primitives 				Apply to objects
	== 						Returns true if the two values 		Returns true if the two values reference
							represent the same value			the same object
	!= 						Returns true if the two values      Returns true if the two values do not
							represent different values			reference the same object
