/*Notes
 	Compilation errors from assignment operators are often overlooked on the exam, in part
	because of how subtle these errors can be. To master the assignment operators, you should
	be fluent in understanding how the compiler handles numeric promotion and when casting
	is required. Being able to spot these issues is critical to passing the exam, as assignment
	operators appear in nearly every question with a code snippet.
