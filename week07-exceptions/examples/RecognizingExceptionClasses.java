		 	You need to recognize three groups of exception classes for the exam: 
			-> RuntimeException,
			-> checked Exception
			-> Error
			
			
			For the exam, you’ll need to recognize which type of an exception it is and whether it’s thrown by
			the Java virtual machine (JVM) or a programmer.
			
			#RuntimeException Classes
			
			RuntimeException and its subclasses are unchecked exceptions that don’t have to be
			handled or declared. They can be thrown by the programmer or by the JVM. Common
			RuntimeException classes include the following:
			
			-> ArithmeticException Thrown when code attempts to divide by zero
			-> ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException Thrown when code uses an illegal index to access an array
			-> ClassCastException Thrown when an attempt is made to cast an object to a class of 
			which it is not an instance
			-> NullPointerException Thrown when there is a null reference where an object is required
			-> IllegalArgumentException Thrown by the programmer to indicate that a method has
			been passed an illegal or inappropriate argument
			-> NumberFormatException Subclass of IllegalArgumentException thrown when an
			attempt is made to convert a string to a numeric type but the string doesn’t have an appropriate
			format
