ðŸ”¹ Challenges for you to practice

-Write a Predicate<User> that filters users whose name starts with "A". 
-Combine this predicate with another one that filters users with age >= 21, using .and().
-Create a method that uses users.removeIf(...) with a Predicate<User> to remove all admins older than 40.
-Rewrite the same logic using a custom Predicate interface (CheckUser).
