1 - Why are Predicate, Supplier, Consumer, and Comparator important in Java?
    A: They make code simpler, more expressive, and declarative. 
	    Predicate<T> : used in filters, validations and Streams
	    Supplier<T>: useful for lazy loading, factory patterns, or providing dependencies
	    Consumer<T>: commonly used for callbacks and foreach
	    Comparator<T>: commom in Collections.sort, TreeSet
