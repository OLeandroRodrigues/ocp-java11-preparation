/*Notes
  When taking the exam, pay close attention to any question involving two
	or more classes related by inheritance. Before even attempting to answer
	the question, you should check that the constructors are properly defined
	using the previous set of rules. You should also verify the classes include
	valid access modifiers for members. Once those are verified, you can continue
	answering the question.
